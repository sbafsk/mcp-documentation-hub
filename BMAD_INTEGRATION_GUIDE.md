## üéØ BMAD Method Implementation

**BMAD = Bias, Motivation, Abilities, Data** - A structured framework for sophisticated AI agent behavior.

### **1. Bias Prevention**

#### **Fairness in Property Recommendations**

- **Client Preference Priority:** Respect client filters over any internal biases

#### **Financial Transparency**
- **Consistent Rules:** Always apply 10% deposit rule for all reservations
- **Commission Clarity:** Transparent 3% + VAT commission structure
- **No Hidden Fees:** All costs clearly communicated to clients
- **Audit Trail:** Every financial transaction logged and traceable

## üèóÔ∏è MCP Integration Strategy

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** ensures AI agents understand operational context dynamically and operate within business constraints.

### **Context Injection**
- **API Schema:** GraphQL SDL definitions for all operations
- **Business Rules:** Deposit percentages, commission structures, VAT calculations
- **Language Packs:** i18n JSON for EN/ES/AR localization
- **Compliance Rules:** AML/KYC requirements, audit requirements

### **Execution Sandbox**
- **GraphQL Only:** Agents operate only within allowed queries/mutations
- **No Raw SQL:** All database operations through GraphQL API
- **Role-Based Access:** Respect user roles (ADMIN, CLIENT, AGENCY)
- **RLS Compliance:** Cannot bypass Row Level Security policies

### **Auditability**
- **Action Logging:** Every agent action logged in AuditLog
- **Admin Console:** Replay and validate all automated actions
- **Traceability:** Complete audit trail for compliance
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track agent efficiency and accuracy

### **Extensibility**
- **Dynamic i18n:** Language context expanded on-demand via MCP
- **Compliance Updates:** New rules injected without code changes
- **Business Logic:** Complex rules updated through configuration
- **Integration Points:** Easy connection to external services

## üìä AI Agent Workflow Examples

### **Example 1: Multilingual Property Query**

**User Prompt:** "Show me apartments in Jos√© Ignacio under $2M"

**Agent Steps:**
1. **Detect Locale:** Identify user language preference (EN/ES/AR)
2. **Build GraphQL Query:**
   ```graphql
query {
  properties(
    filter: { city: "Jos√© Ignacio", price_lt: 2000000 }
  ) {
    id
    title
    price
    images
       agency { name }
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Apply Bias Prevention:** Rank by objective criteria (price, availability, amenities)
4. **Return Response:** Pass through i18n ‚Üí User's language
5. **Log Action:** Record query in AuditLog for compliance

### **Example 2: Tour Reservation with Business Rules**

**User Prompt:** "Book a tour for Property #42 on Sept 15"

**Agent Steps:**
1. **Validate User Role:** Ensure user role = CLIENT
2. **Check Business Rules:** Verify 10% deposit requirement
3. **Generate GraphQL Mutation:**
   ```graphql
mutation {
  createTourReservation(
    input: { propertyId: "42", scheduledDate: "2025-09-15" }
  ) {
    id
    depositAmount
    status
       property { title, price }
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Trigger Payment:** Integrate with Stripe for 10% deposit
5. **Log Action:** Record reservation in AuditLog
6. **Send Confirmation:** Multilingual confirmation email

### **Example 3: Admin Compliance Audit**

**Prompt:** "Show all reservations with deposits pending"

**Agent Steps:**
1. **Validate Admin Role:** Ensure user role = ADMIN
2. **Query GraphQL:**
   ```graphql
query {
  tourReservations(filter: { status: PENDING }) {
    id
       user { email, name }
       property { title, price }
    depositAmount
       scheduledDate
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Generate Report:** Structured table with compliance data
4. **Log Audit:** Record admin action in AuditLog
5. **Return Results:** Formatted for admin console
