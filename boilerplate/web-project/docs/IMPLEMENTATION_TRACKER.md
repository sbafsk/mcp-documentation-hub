## üéØ **AI Integration Approach**

### **What We Need (Practical Value):**
1. **Better AI Context** - Enhanced documentation access for AI agents
2. **MCP Integration** - Simple 2-server setup for immediate value
3. **Practical Patterns** - Focus on real development patterns, not enterprise complexity
4. **Quality Code Generation** - Better component and hook generation
5. **Workflow Automation** - Basic MCP integration for development tasks

### **What We Don't Need (Overkill):**
- ‚ùå Complex MCP server architecture (6+ servers)
- ‚ùå Database server integration (existing [API choice] hooks work fine)
- ‚ùå Audit logging and compliance systems
- ‚ùå Enterprise-level security layers
- ‚ùå Overly complex automation workflows

### **Enhanced Implementation:**
```json
// .ai/mcp-config.json (enhanced setup)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "project-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./docs"]
    },
    "project-standards": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./standards"]
    }
  }
}
```
