## üöÄ **Current Development Priorities**

### **Priority 1: Production Deployment**
- [x] ‚úÖ Vercel deployment configuration - **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Production environment setup
- [ ] Supabase production database
- [ ] Custom domain and SSL
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking

### **Priority 2: Business Features**
- [ ] Stripe payment integration
- [ ] Email notification system
- [ ] Admin dashboard with analytics
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering

### **Priority 3: Enhanced AI Development Experience**

---

## üéØ **Simplified AI Integration Approach**

### **What We Need (Practical Value):**
1. **Better AI Context** - Enhanced documentation access for AI assistants
2. **Practical Patterns** - Focus on real development patterns, not enterprise complexity
3. **Quality Code Generation** - Better component and hook generation

### **What We Don't Need (Overkill):**
- ‚ùå Complex MCP server architecture (6 servers)
- ‚ùå Database server integration (existing GraphQL hooks work great)
- ‚ùå Audit logging and compliance systems
- ‚ùå Enterprise-level security layers

### **Simplified Implementation:**
```json
// cursor/config.json (minimal setup)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "avent-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./docs"]
    },
    "avent-rules": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./rules"]
    }
  }
}
```
