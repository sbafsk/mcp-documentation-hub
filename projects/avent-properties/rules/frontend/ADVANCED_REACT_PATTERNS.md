## Project Structure & Learning Methodology

### File Organization
```
src/
├── exercise/          # Learning exercises with TODOs
├── final/            # Complete implementations
├── __tests__/        # Test suites for validation
├── examples/         # Real-world examples
└── switch.js         # Base component for exercises
```

### Learning Progression
Each pattern follows this structure:
1. **Background** - Understanding the problem and real-world applications
2. **Exercise** - Hands-on implementation with guided TODOs
3. **Final Solution** - Complete, production-ready implementation
4. **Extra Credits** - Advanced variations and edge cases
5. **Tests** - Validation of functionality

---

## Pattern 1: Context Module Functions

### Core Concept
**One-liner**: Encapsulate complex state changes into utility functions that can be tree-shaken and lazily loaded.

### Problem Solved
- Reduces duplication in context consumers
- Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Provides cleaner API for complex state operations
- Enables better code organization and testing

### Key Implementation Points

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Helper functions in context (causes re-renders)
const value = {state, increment, decrement}

// ✅ Good: Module-level functions that accept dispatch
const increment = dispatch => dispatch({type: 'increment'})
const decrement = dispatch => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})
```

### Training Focus Areas
1. **State Management**: Understanding useReducer with complex state
2. **Async Operations**: Handling loading, success, and error states
3. **Function Composition**: Creating reusable action creators
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and user feedback

### Real-World Applications
- User profile management
- Shopping cart operations
- Form state management
- API data fetching patterns

---

## Pattern 2: Compound Components

### Core Concept
**One-liner**: Components that work together to form a complete UI, sharing state implicitly through React.Children.map and React.cloneElement.

### Problem Solved
- Provides flexible, declarative APIs
- Allows custom composition of UI elements
- Maintains implicit state sharing
- Enables better component reusability

### Key Implementation Points

```javascript
// Parent component manages state and clones children
function Toggle({children}) {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)
  
  return React.Children.map(children, child =>
    React.cloneElement(child, {on, toggle})
  )
}

// Child components receive props implicitly
function ToggleOn({on, children}) {
  return on ? children : null
}
```

### Training Focus Areas
1. **React.Children API**: Understanding Children.map, Children.forEach
2. **React.cloneElement**: Proper prop forwarding and merging
3. **Component Composition**: Designing flexible component APIs
4. **Type Safety**: Handling different child types (DOM vs composite)

### Real-World Applications
- Form field groups
- Tab components
- Accordion interfaces
- Modal dialogs

---

## Pattern 3: Flexible Compound Components

### Core Concept
**One-liner**: Compound components using React Context to share state across any level of the component tree.

### Problem Solved
- Removes limitations of immediate children only
- Enables deeper component nesting
- Provides more flexible component composition
- Maintains clean separation of concerns

### Key Implementation Points

```javascript
// Context for state sharing
const ToggleContext = React.createContext()

// Provider manages state
function Toggle({children}) {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)
  
  return (
    <ToggleContext.Provider value={{on, toggle}}>
      {children}
    </ToggleContext.Provider>
  )
}

// Custom hook for consuming context
function useToggle() {
  return React.useContext(ToggleContext)
}
```

### Training Focus Areas
1. **React Context**: Understanding Provider/Consumer pattern
2. **Custom Hooks**: Creating reusable context consumers
3. **Error Boundaries**: Handling context usage outside provider
4. **Performance**: Avoiding unnecessary re-renders

### Real-World Applications
- Navigation menus
- Data tables with complex interactions
- Multi-step forms
- Dashboard layouts

---

## Pattern 4: Prop Collections and Getters

### Core Concept
**One-liner**: Provide pre-configured prop objects and functions to make common use cases easier to implement correctly.

### Problem Solved
- Reduces boilerplate for common patterns
- Ensures accessibility compliance
- Prevents common implementation mistakes
- Provides better developer experience

### Key Implementation Points

```javascript
// Prop Collections (static objects)
function useToggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)
  
  return {
    on,
    toggle,
    togglerProps: {
      'aria-pressed': on,
      onClick: toggle,
    }
  }
}

// Prop Getters (functions for composition)
function getTogglerProps({onClick, ...props} = {}) {
  return {
    'aria-pressed': on,
    onClick: callAll(onClick, toggle),
    ...props,
  }
}
```

### Training Focus Areas
1. **Accessibility**: Understanding ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
2. **Function Composition**: Creating composable prop functions
3. **Event Handling**: Proper event handler merging
4. **API Design**: Balancing simplicity with flexibility

### Real-World Applications
- Form controls
- Interactive widgets
- Custom input components
- Toggle switches and buttons

---

## Pattern 5: State Reducer

### Core Concept
**One-liner**: Invert control over state management to allow users to customize state changes while maintaining the component's core functionality.

### Problem Solved
- Enables complex state logic customization
- Maintains component flexibility
- Allows feature additions without API changes
- Provides escape hatches for edge cases

### Key Implementation Points

```javascript
// Default reducer
function toggleReducer(state, {type, initialState}) {
  switch (type) {
    case 'toggle': return {on: !state.on}
    case 'reset': return initialState
    default: throw new Error(`Unsupported type: ${type}`)
  }
}

// Custom reducer with additional logic
function customReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'toggle' && timesClicked >= 4) {
    return {on: state.on} // Prevent toggle
  }
  return toggleReducer(state, action) // Use default behavior
}
```

### Training Focus Areas
1. **Reducer Pattern**: Understanding state transitions
2. **Inversion of Control**: Designing flexible APIs
3. **State Logic**: Complex conditional state updates
4. **Action Types**: Consistent action naming and structure

### Real-World Applications
- Form validation
- Multi-step wizards
- Complex UI interactions
- Data filtering and sorting

---

## Pattern 6: Control Props

### Core Concept
**One-liner**: Allow external control of component state while maintaining internal state as fallback, similar to controlled form inputs.

### Problem Solved
- Enables external state management
- Supports synchronized components
- Provides programmatic control
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Key Implementation Points

```javascript
function useToggle({
  initialOn = false,
  reducer = toggleReducer,
  onChange,
  on: controlledOn,
} = {}) {
  const onIsControlled = controlledOn != null
  const on = onIsControlled ? controlledOn : state.on
  
  function dispatchWithOnChange(action) {
    if (!onIsControlled) {
      dispatch(action)
    }
    onChange?.(reducer({...state, on}, action), action)
  }
}
```

### Training Focus Areas
1. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled**: Understanding the pattern
2. **State Synchronization**: Managing multiple component instances
3. **Warning Systems**: Developer experience improvements
4. **API Consistency**: Maintaining predictable behavior

### Real-World Applications
- Form libraries
- Data visualization components
- Interactive dashboards
- Multi-select interfaces
